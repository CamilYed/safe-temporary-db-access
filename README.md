# Secure and Temporary Access to Production Databases

This project is a **proof of concept (PoC)** for building a secure, temporary access system for production databases, designed for developers and operations teams. It provides **time-limited**, **audited**, and **least-privilege** database access with optional network monitoring.

The core idea: let developers request short-lived database access through a secure API. Access is granted with minimal permissions, and then revoked automatically after a defined TTL.

---

## üí° Key Principles

- **Security First**: time-limited credentials, no password reuse, audit logs.
- **TDD-Driven Development**: features are always implemented after writing readable, expressive tests.
- **Database-Agnostic Core**: PostgreSQL support first, with extensibility for other databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL).

---

### üîê Temporary Credential Generation

Every temporary access request generates **strong, cryptographically secure credentials**, designed to meet strong security and entropy requirements.

**Username:**

- 12 characters long
- Lowercase letters and digits only (`[a-z0-9]`)
- Example: `user7g5m9dzq`

**Password:**

- 16 characters long
- Must include:
   - At least 1 uppercase letter (A‚ÄìZ)
   - At least 1 lowercase letter (a‚Äìz)
   - At least 1 digit (0‚Äì9)
   - At least 1 special character (`!@#$%^&*()-_+=<>?`)
- Contains at least 10 unique characters
- High entropy (‚â• 50 bits), safe against brute-force and predictable patterns
- Example: `G7$pxR!dKmZ&20#b`

Credential generation is tested for format and entropy strength.

### üìú JWT Format & Cryptographic Constraints

All access tokens must comply with strict security requirements:

- **Signed using ECDSA with EC256 curve (prime256v1)**
- **5 minutes maximum TTL (expiration limit)**
- **Public key must be at least 256 bits**
- **Unsigned tokens or other algorithms (e.g. RSA) are rejected**
- **Claims must contain:**
   - `sub` ‚Äì username (subject)
   - `iat` ‚Äì issued at timestamp
   - `exp` ‚Äì expiration timestamp (‚â§ 5 min)
   - `iss` ‚Äì must be `"dbaccess-api"`
   - `aud` ‚Äì must include `"dbaccess-client"`

Example JWT claims:

```json
{
  "sub": "alice",
  "iat": 1712491200,
  "exp": 1712491500,
  "iss": "dbaccess-api",
  "aud": ["dbaccess-client"]
}
```

These constraints are enforced in `JwtTokenVerifier.java` and thoroughly tested in:
- [JwtTokenVerifierSpec.groovy](https://github.com/CamilYed/safe-temporary-db-access/blob/main/dbaccess/src/test/groovy/pl/pw/cyber/dbaccess/infrastructure/spring/security/JwtTokenVerifierSpec.groovy)
- [JwtTokenVerifierIntegrationIT.groovy](https://github.com/CamilYed/safe-temporary-db-access/blob/main/dbaccess/src/integrationTest/groovy/pl/pw/cyber/dbaccess/infrastructure/spring/security/JwtTokenVerifierIntegrationIT.groovy)

## [TODO] üê≥ Running Locally with Docker Compose

1. **Generate EC keys** for JWT (using OpenSSL):

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ec256-private.pem

# Extract public key (in PEM)
openssl ec -in ec256-private.pem -pubout -out ec256-public.pem

# Convert public key to DER format (required by the app)
openssl ec -in ec256-private.pem -pubout -outform DER -out ec256-public.der
```

2. **Set environment variables** (or `.env` file):

```env
TEST1_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test
TEST1_DB_USERNAME=admin
TEST1_DB_PASSWORD=admin
```

3. **Start with Docker Compose** (MongoDB + PostgreSQL):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
./gradlew bootRun
```

4. **Login with a token**: JWT subject must be one of the users listed in `example-users.yaml`:

```yaml
allowlist:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie
```

---

## ‚úÖ Static Configuration

### example-users.yaml

```yaml
allowlist:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie
```

### db-access.yaml

```yaml
db:
  databases:
    test1:
      envPrefix: TEST1
    test2:
      envPrefix: TEST2
```

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Java 21 + Groovy (Spock)
- Spring Boot 3
- Gradle
- PostgreSQL (target DB)
- MongoDB (audit logs)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- JWT (auth)
- Suricata (optional IDS)

## üîê PostgreSQL Permission Model ‚Äì Explained

PostgreSQL uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with granular privileges at various levels (database, schema, table, function).  
Full list in [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html)

### ‚ùó Why only a subset of permissions?

This system is designed for **safe and temporary developer access**.  
Granting the full range of PostgreSQL privileges (like `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `EXECUTE`) would risk:

- accidental data loss or corruption,
- bypassing audit/approval flows,
- security violations.

We intentionally support a **narrow, safe subset of permissions**, mapped to abstract roles in the app.

 * Supported PostgreSQL versions: 12.x ‚Äì 16.x
---

### ‚úÖ Supported Permission Levels

```java
enum PermissionLevel {
    READ_ONLY,
    READ_WRITE,
    DELETE
}
```

| Permission Level | SQL Grants                                        | Notes                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| READ_ONLY        | CONNECT, USAGE, SELECT                            | For read-only diagnostics    |
| READ_WRITE       | CONNECT, USAGE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE            | For temporary fix/debugging  |
| DELETE           | + DELETE (in addition to READ_WRITE)              | Requires separate approval   |

> ‚úÖ These correspond to real PostgreSQL privileges granted to a temporary user.

---

### üß™ Example: Creating a Read-Only PostgreSQL Role

```sql
CREATE ROLE temp_read_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepwd';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO temp_read_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO temp_read_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO temp_read_user;
```

---

## üîå Abstraction for Future Database Engines

To support other databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL):

1. Define abstract permission levels in the app: `READ_ONLY`, `READ_WRITE`, `DELETE`, `ADMIN`, etc.
2. Implement `DatabaseAccessProvider` interface:
```java
interface DatabaseAccessProvider {
    void createTemporaryUser(String username, Duration ttl, PermissionLevel level);
    void revokeUser(String username);
}
```
3. Add implementations per engine:
   - `PostgresAccessProvider`
   - `OracleAccessProvider`
   - `MySQLAccessProvider`
4. Core logic must remain **DB-agnostic** and depend only on the interface.

## üöÄ Summary

This project is being developed as part of a postgraduate engineering program in Cybersecurity Engineering (2024/2025) at Warsaw University of Technology.

Its goal is to demonstrate a practical and secure solution to a common real-world problem: enabling temporary and auditable access to production databases in emergency or debugging scenarios. The solution emphasizes automation, granular permissions, time-bound access, and audit logging ‚Äî all aligned with modern cybersecurity best practices.
