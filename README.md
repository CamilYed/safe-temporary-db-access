# Secure and Temporary Access to Production Databases

This project is a **proof of concept (PoC)** for building a secure, temporary access system for production databases, designed for developers and operations teams. It provides **time-limited**, **audited**, and **least-privilege** database access with optional network monitoring.

The core idea: let developers request short-lived database access through a secure API. Access is granted with minimal permissions, and then revoked automatically after a defined TTL.

---

## 💡 Key Principles

- **Security First**: time-limited credentials, no password reuse, audit logs.
- **TDD-Driven Development**: features are always implemented after writing readable, expressive tests.
- **Database-Agnostic Core**: PostgreSQL support first, with extensibility for other databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL).

---

### 🔐 Temporary Credential Generation

Every temporary access request generates **strong, cryptographically secure credentials**, designed to meet strong security and entropy requirements.

**Username:**

- 12 characters long
- Lowercase letters and digits only (`[a-z0-9]`)
- Example: `user7g5m9dzq`

**Password:**

- 16 characters long
- Must include:
   - At least 1 uppercase letter (A–Z)
   - At least 1 lowercase letter (a–z)
   - At least 1 digit (0–9)
   - At least 1 special character (`!@#$%^&*()-_+=<>?`)
- Contains at least 10 unique characters
- High entropy (≥ 50 bits), safe against brute-force and predictable patterns
- Example: `G7$pxR!dKmZ&20#b`

Credential generation is tested for format and entropy strength.

### 📜 JWT Format & Cryptographic Constraints

All access tokens must comply with strict security requirements:

- **Signed using ECDSA with EC256 curve (prime256v1)**
- **5 minutes maximum TTL (expiration limit)**
- **Public key must be at least 256 bits**
- **Unsigned tokens or other algorithms (e.g. RSA) are rejected**
- **Claims must contain:**
   - `sub` – username (subject)
   - `iat` – issued at timestamp
   - `exp` – expiration timestamp (≤ 5 min)
   - `iss` – must be `"dbaccess-api"`
   - `aud` – must include `"dbaccess-client"`

Example JWT claims:

```json
{
  "sub": "alice",
  "iat": 1712491200,
  "exp": 1712491500,
  "iss": "dbaccess-api",
  "aud": ["dbaccess-client"]
}
```

These constraints are enforced in `JwtTokenVerifier.java` and thoroughly tested in:
- [JwtTokenVerifierSpec.groovy](https://github.com/CamilYed/safe-temporary-db-access/blob/main/dbaccess/src/test/groovy/pl/pw/cyber/dbaccess/infrastructure/spring/security/JwtTokenVerifierSpec.groovy)
- [JwtTokenVerifierIntegrationIT.groovy](https://github.com/CamilYed/safe-temporary-db-access/blob/main/dbaccess/src/integrationTest/groovy/pl/pw/cyber/dbaccess/infrastructure/spring/security/JwtTokenVerifierIntegrationIT.groovy)

## ✅ Project Checklist

### 🛠️ Phase 0: Setup

- [✅] Spring Boot 3 + Gradle
- [✅] Spock integration (Groovy-based testing)
- [✅] GitHub Actions for CI
- [✅] SonarCloud integration (coverage, SAST)
- [✅] Docker Compose for local development
- [✅] EC256 key pair generation for JWT (DER-encoded public key)
- [✅] `.yaml`-based database and allowlist configuration

### 🔐 Step 1: Auth & JWT

- [✅] Reject missing JWT → 401
- [✅] Reject expired JWT → 401
- [✅] Reject JWT with long TTL → 401
- [✅] Reject invalid JWT format → 401
- [✅] Reject unauthorized subject not on allowlist → 403
- [✅] Reject unauthorized subject due to null → 403 
- [✅] Reject unauthorized subject due to blank → 403
- [✅] Accept valid subject from allowlist → 200
- [✅] Accept token signed with valid EC private key → subject, issuer, audience verified
- [✅] Verifies token signed with correct EC key
- [✅] Rejects token signed with wrong EC key → "Invalid signature"
- [✅] Rejects unsigned token → "Not a JWS header"
- [✅] Rejects expired token → "Token expired"
- [✅] Rejects RSA-signed token → "Invalid token"
- [✅] Rejects token with incorrect `iss` → "Invalid issuer"
- [✅] Rejects token with incorrect `aud` → "Invalid audience

### ⚙️ Step 2: Input Validation (Request Validator)

- [✅] Required fields: permissionLevel, durationMinutes, targetDatabase
- [✅] permissionLevel: must be one of READ_ONLY, READ_WRITE, DELETE
- [✅] durationMinutes: must be between 1 and 60
- [✅] targetDatabase must be resolvable
- [✅] Reject invalid request → 400 + details
- [✅] Multiple errors → return combined list
- [✅] Accept valid request → 200
- [✅] No excessive error details returned to client

### 🌐 Step 3: Functional Core Logic (Access Granting)

- [✅] READ_ONLY → user with SELECT privilege (AccessRequestEndpointIT)
- [✅] READ_WRITE → adds INSERT, UPDATE
- [✅] DELETE → adds DELETE permission
- [✅] Forbidden actions rejected based on permission
- [✅] Revoke access after TTL via scheduler
- [✅] Credentials only returned once
- [✅] User roles removed after expiry
- [✅] Safe failure handling if DB is unavailable (no exception thrown)
- [✅] Invalid usernames/roles (SQL injection) → logged and skipped
- [✅] Unsafe identifiers logged at ERROR level
- [✅] Credential generation tested in isolation

### 🧪 Step 4: PostgreSQL Specifics

- [✅] Temporary users are visible in `pg_roles`
- [✅] Permissions match selected level
- [✅] Attempted forbidden operations (e.g. DROP) rejected
- [✅] Users revoked automatically after TTL
- [✅] Users with no roles are still revoked cleanly

### 📝 Step 5: Audit Logging (MongoDB)

- [✅] Audit log entry created for access request
- [✅] Audit contains: requestor, target DB, username, permission, TTL
- [✅] Password is NOT stored
- [✅] Revoked status is properly updated
- [✅] Invalid logs (e.g., unknown DB) are ignored, not removed

### 🔎 Phase 6: Security Coverage

- [✅] Code coverage over 80% (verified in SonarCloud)
- [✅] Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- [ ] [Optional] GitHub Action: Penetration Test with OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite

## [TODO] 🐳 Running Locally with Docker Compose

1. **Generate EC keys** for JWT (using OpenSSL):

```bash
# Generate private key
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ec256-private.pem

# Extract public key (in PEM)
openssl ec -in ec256-private.pem -pubout -out ec256-public.pem

# Convert public key to DER format (required by the app)
openssl ec -in ec256-private.pem -pubout -outform DER -out ec256-public.der
```

2. **Set environment variables** (or `.env` file):

```env
TEST1_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test
TEST1_DB_USERNAME=admin
TEST1_DB_PASSWORD=admin
```

3. **Start with Docker Compose** (MongoDB + PostgreSQL):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
./gradlew bootRun
```

4. **Login with a token**: JWT subject must be one of the users listed in `example-users.yaml`:

```yaml
allowlist:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie
```

---

## ✅ Static Configuration

### example-users.yaml

```yaml
allowlist:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie
```

### db-access.yaml

```yaml
db:
  databases:
    test1:
      envPrefix: TEST1
    test2:
      envPrefix: TEST2
```

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Java 21 + Groovy (Spock)
- Spring Boot 3
- Gradle
- PostgreSQL (target DB)
- MongoDB (audit logs)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- JWT (auth)
- Suricata (optional IDS)

## 🔐 PostgreSQL Permission Model – Explained

PostgreSQL uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with granular privileges at various levels (database, schema, table, function).  
Full list in [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html)

### ❗ Why only a subset of permissions?

This system is designed for **safe and temporary developer access**.  
Granting the full range of PostgreSQL privileges (like `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `EXECUTE`) would risk:

- accidental data loss or corruption,
- bypassing audit/approval flows,
- security violations.

We intentionally support a **narrow, safe subset of permissions**, mapped to abstract roles in the app.

 * Supported PostgreSQL versions: 12.x – 16.x
---

### ✅ Supported Permission Levels

```java
enum PermissionLevel {
    READ_ONLY,
    READ_WRITE,
    DELETE
}
```

| Permission Level | SQL Grants                                        | Notes                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| READ_ONLY        | CONNECT, USAGE, SELECT                            | For read-only diagnostics    |
| READ_WRITE       | CONNECT, USAGE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE            | For temporary fix/debugging  |
| DELETE           | + DELETE (in addition to READ_WRITE)              | Requires separate approval   |

> ✅ These correspond to real PostgreSQL privileges granted to a temporary user.

---

### 🧪 Example: Creating a Read-Only PostgreSQL Role

```sql
CREATE ROLE temp_read_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepwd';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO temp_read_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO temp_read_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO temp_read_user;
```

---

## 🔌 Abstraction for Future Database Engines

To support other databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL):

1. Define abstract permission levels in the app: `READ_ONLY`, `READ_WRITE`, `DELETE`, `ADMIN`, etc.
2. Implement `DatabaseAccessProvider` interface:
```java
interface DatabaseAccessProvider {
    void createTemporaryUser(String username, Duration ttl, PermissionLevel level);
    void revokeUser(String username);
}
```
3. Add implementations per engine:
   - `PostgresAccessProvider`
   - `OracleAccessProvider`
   - `MySQLAccessProvider`
4. Core logic must remain **DB-agnostic** and depend only on the interface.
